# Connect Four
My solution to the Connect Four project in The Odin Project Ruby path.

## What I learned
This project was to train testing skills using Rspec. It was really interesting figuring out which methods need to be tested and which don't, how to set up tests, and writing code the other way around: test first, code implementation second. I think after practicing writing tests for this project I am much better at it. However, I did take a few long breaks while working on this project so I will definitely need to continue working with Rspec so that it really gets cemented in my mind.

## Room to grow
As mentioned above I think I grasped the basics about testing, but I definitely still need more practice.
